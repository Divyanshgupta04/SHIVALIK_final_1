# Navbar Dropdown Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed:

The profile dropdown menu was being cut off at the top because the navbar had `overflow-hidden` applied to it.

## Problem:

```jsx
// BEFORE - This was cutting off the dropdown
<motion.div className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 w-full z-40 shadow-md overflow-hidden">
  {/* Navbar content */}
</motion.div>
```

The `overflow-hidden` on the navbar container was preventing the dropdown (which extends below the navbar) from being fully visible.

## Solution:

1. **Removed `overflow-hidden` from the main navbar container**
2. **Added `overflow-hidden` only to the background wrapper**

```jsx
// AFTER - Dropdown can now extend freely
<motion.div className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 w-full z-40 shadow-md">
  {/* Background wrapper with overflow hidden */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
    {/* Background image and overlay */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Navbar content and dropdown can extend */}
</motion.div>
```

## What This Fixes:

### Before:
- Profile dropdown was cut off at the top
- Text like "Hello, divyansh gupta" was partially hidden
- Dropdown appeared incomplete

### After:
- ✅ Full profile dropdown is visible
- ✅ All text is readable
- ✅ "Hello, [username]" fully visible
- ✅ "ACCOUNT SETTINGS" visible
- ✅ "SIGN OUT" button visible
- ✅ Background image still properly contained

## Technical Details:

### Z-Index Hierarchy:
- Navbar: `z-40`
- Profile dropdown: `z-[9999]` (very high to appear above everything)
- Search overlay: `z-[9998]`
- Sidebar: `z-[9997]`

### Why It Works:
- The profile dropdown has a very high z-index (`z-[9999]`)
- It's positioned `absolute` relative to the profile button
- With `overflow-hidden` removed from navbar, the dropdown can extend downward
- Background is still clipped by the inner wrapper's `overflow-hidden`

## How to Test:

1. **Refresh your browser** with `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Go to the home page: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Click the **profile icon** (user icon) in the top-right
4. The dropdown should now be **fully visible** with:
   - "Hello, [your name]" at the top
   - "ACCOUNT SETTINGS" link
   - "SIGN OUT" button at the bottom

## Files Modified:

- `src/Components/Navbar.jsx`
  - Removed `overflow-hidden` from main navbar container (line 54)
  - Added wrapper div with `overflow-hidden` for background only (line 61)

✅ **The profile dropdown is now fully visible and functional!**

Just refresh your browser to see the fix.
